# Supplementary material for a paper on the applicability of the generalized power-law discharge rating curve model
The document contains the results from fitting the four discharge rating curve models in the generalized power-law class to data from 180 rivers in Iceland (SM_ICELAND_7-366), Sweden (SM_SWEDEN_367-726), and the United States (SM_USA_727-1086). Each dataset is assigned a data-description page, four pages to present the different model fits, and a model-comparison page.
